# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

Description:

User enumeration is when a malicious actor can use brute-force techniques to either guess or confirm valid users in a system. User enumeration is often a web application vulnerability, though it can also be found in any system that requires user authentication. Two of the most common areas where user enumeration occurs are in a site's login page and its â€˜Forgot Password' functionality

In this case escenario go to the main login. If the wrong password is entered and the user exists, the error is bold. If the wrong password is entered and the user does not exist, the error just plain text.
